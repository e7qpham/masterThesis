#### Summary
The objective of this study is to demonstrate the role of large-scale hydrogen storage
in the German energy system in 2030, thereby proving its utility in reaching the
first phase of Kernnetz in 2032. With the number of underground hydrogen storage
units integrated in this study, the storage capacity of this component could reach to
6.8 TWh. This means that underground hydrogen storage can provide more buffer
for the power grid during the intermittency of renewables, which helps secure grid
stability. Consequently, the curtailment of renewables decreases in onshore wind
when there is more buffer for the hydrogen storage capacity. Grid flexibility can
also be enhanced by large-scale storage, which offers a longer period of hydrogen
supply during the deficit season and efficiently handles the peak load. In scenarios
with different hydrogen storage build-ups, the system cost showed a decreasing
trend when the hydrogen storage capacity of the salt caverns increased. Although
hydrogen grid expansion is required to carry more load from more hydrogen storage
capacity, it still considers economic benefits, as the system cost is reduced to 16%
compared to having overground tanks and to 4% compared to existing salt caverns.
The study also found an increase in the use of hydrogen in the industrial sector via
methanation, Fischer-Tropsch, and re-electrification processes to produce more green
fuel liquid, which is a good substitute for the current fossil fuel liquid. However,
the hydrogen consumption in these processes is not high because fuels produced
from green hydrogen are considered more expensive. Meanwhile, having a higher
underground hydrogen storage capacity does not have an impact on the transport
and heating sectors, indicating the main role of salt caverns in supporting the
decarbonization of the industry sector.
Finally, the large-scale underground salt cavern in Germany has made this country
the leader in the European hydrogen market by 2030. This storage ramp-up not
only provides continuous hydrogen transport but also secures its national hydrogen
transport to central regions. Meanwhile, the UK, Netherlands, Belgium, and Denmark
have played a major role in the German import/export market. An extended grid
must be created in this corridor to handle the capacities of these exporting/importing
routes. The implementation of large-scale hydrogen storage in the German energy
system can expand the hydrogen market in Europe, in particular, the electrolysis
market in several areas, and modify local hydrogen hubs in the Netherlands, France,
61and Spain. In Germany, large-scale salt caverns also offer locational marginal
hydrogen price drops further south. Furthermore, the integration of hydrogen
storage in Germany could lead to grid congestion in these market corridors. Thus,
both regional and technical support are needed to upgrade these hydrogen pipelines
for carrying weighted capacities while collaborating strategies in these hydrogen
market areas.
